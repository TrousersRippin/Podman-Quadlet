# My Podman Quadlet files

This repository contains my personal collection of podman-quadlet files to run in rootless mode.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Git & Podman installed on your system.

## Installation

Pull the repo into an empty folder. In some case you need to create an env variables file.

Make the required directories.
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/containers/systemd $HOME/containers/storage
```
